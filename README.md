# 3d-Models

Each folder contains different interactive 3D models of objects of mathematical analysis. They can be twisted and scaled. You can also change various constants that define the model.
To view the selected model, you need to click on the folder with the corresponding name. Then click on the examples folder, then click on the main example folder. You will see the html file. And it needs to be opened in a Google Chrome browser.

I used mainly Java Script, html and css. All models are visualized with library grafar.
